Hangman - Personal planning for program:

***Bronze***

*1.)* Create a simple hangman game

*2.)* Organize as much JS in a way that falls onto each other
-In order to keep it easy to read

*3.)* The hardest part of this program is the loop that passes the user choices
and continues them passed the wins/loses

*4.)* Registers wins and loses

//My major goal here is to have functioning pieces of the program, while
while neglecting CSS for the time being

***Silver***

*1.)* CSS

*2.)* Multiple pages

*3.)* Multiple game types:
-*Solo-in progress*
*Multi-Finished*

***Gold***

*1.)* Wins produce a cool effect, loses produce a funny effect

*2.)* Some kind of sounds upon starting a new game

*3.)* Install JSON list into 'Solo'
