Hangman: User stories:
***Simplify***
As a User I want:
*Bronze*:

*1.)* I want a hangman game that is simple and multiplayer. One player will type in a word and the other will guess it. The number of blank spaces for guesses should be the same as however many letters are in the word typed by player one.

*2.)* I want a game organized with letters and inputs on the bottom, while the noose-post is fully visible on the top.
*Silver*

*3.)* I want a timer that counts down because I want to see how quickly I can figure out the word and save my stick friend's life.

*4.)* I want to be able to choose to what word I want to use in order to have a more challenging game.

*5.)* I want one user to be able to pick a word and another solve the word.

*6.)* Wrong letters should be listed in an area so I know what's not correct.

*7.)* Every incorrect answer answer should add a new body part to the noose to tell me how many more chances I have at building the word.

*Gold*

*8.)* Effect feature - (i.e. Chuck Norris with the thumbs up)
